All you need to do is pay a small processing fee of $20 to receive your gift card.  receiver: That's so exciting! Can you tell me more about the database you used? Was it from a specific store or website I visited?  caller: Uh, no, ma'am. It was just a general database. Don't worry about that. Would you like to proceed with the payment?  receiver: Okay, but how do I know this is legit? Can you provide me with a website or phone number to verify this offer?  caller: I understand your concern, ma'am. Unfortunately, we're a new company, and our website is still under construction. But trust me, this is a legitimate offer. Many people have already received their gift cards.  receiver: That's strange.

How did you know it was on my computer? caller: We have advanced software that detects these kinds of threats. We've been monitoring your IP address and we saw some suspicious activity. receiver: I see. Can you tell me more about this software? Is it free? caller: Yes, it's absolutely free. We just need to remote access your computer to run the scan and remove the virus. receiver: Remote access? How does that work? Do I need to download something? caller: Yes, you'll need to download our remote desktop tool. It's completely safe and secure. receiver: Okay, but how do I know it's not malware itself? caller: I assure you, sir, it's 100% legitimate. We're a Microsoft certified partner. receiver: Can you give me your Microsoft certification number so I can verify it? caller: Uh, let me check on that. Can you please hold for just a minute? receiver: Sure thing. Take your time. caller: Okay, I'm back. Unfortunately, our certification number is not publicly available due to security reasons. receiver: I see. Well, in that case, can you walk me through the process of removing the virus manually? I'd rather not download any software. caller: I'm afraid that's not possible, sir. The virus is too complex and requires our specialized tools to remove. receiver: Okay, well maybe I can take my computer to a local repair shop then. caller: No, no, no! You shouldn't do that! They won't be able to fix it and they might even make it worse! receiver: Really? Why's that? caller: Because they're not certified Microsoft partners like us. They don't have the necessary expertise or equipment. receiver: I'm not sure...can you give me a call back number so I can think about it and call you back later? caller: Sir, this is an urgent matter!
